# Frequently asked questions

**Nearby stops aren't updating** – Fetching nearby stops requires a GPS signal which might take some time. Try waiting a while, or going outside. The progress bar indicates if the app is waiting for location (⅓) or for API response (⅔).

**Long loading times** – If the loading bar consistently goes very far, this means that the responses are too large and must be requested again, asking for less data. Consider lowering “Default Time Window” in settings.
