**Requirements** – The app uses Internet for making requests and GPS for fetching nearby stops. Minimum API level is 3.2.0.

**APIs** – Data is retrieved using Trafiklab's APIs "SL Nearby stops 2" and "SL Transport". Avgånär is in no way affiliated with Trafiklab or SL. Avgånär can not guarantee that presented data (e.g. departure times) are always correct, and assume no liability for missed departures.
